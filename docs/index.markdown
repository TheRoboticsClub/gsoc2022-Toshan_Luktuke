  Improving Visual Circuit
---

Visual Circuit is an open source tool to develop robotic applications. It aims to make developing applications for ROS and Gazebo simple and user friendly by its intuitive block-based interface. Users have the ablity to drag and drop blocks to develop their logic. Users are also able to build completely custom blocks as well as edit code in the existing blocks, this makes Visual Circuit a robust and powerful tool to develop even complicated applications. The aim of this project is to make Visual Circuit cross-platform by porting wires to the Python Shared Memory Implementation. The requirements of the project are:
- Update code in order to make inter-process communication work with Python Shared Memory Objects
- Update block templates in order to work with the new Shared Memory Implementation
- Make demo applications to showcase how Visual Circuit can be used
