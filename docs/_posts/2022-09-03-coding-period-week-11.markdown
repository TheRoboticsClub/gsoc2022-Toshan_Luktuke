Going by the suggestions of my mentors, I spent this week working on the documentation of the blocks and some updates to my blog.

## Documentation

After a meet with my mentors, I spent some time organising the documentations files. Then I changed the theme to dark mode to go with the overall look of Visual Circuit Website. Once that was done I made a Pull Request integrating the changes to the `docs` branch of the repo.

Next we'll merge it with the main website. However, I have to make some decisions about how to update the docstrings in the actual JSON files.
