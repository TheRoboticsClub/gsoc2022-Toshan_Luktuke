In my previous posts I had highlighted the challenges I faced while installing Jde Drones and getting code running on it. Next after these steps was to solve some of the JdeAcademy exercises. The main goal for this week was to get the solutions running using Visual Circuit.

### Work Approach
I decided to first solve the exercises using Python in the `my_solution.py` file. Once the exercise was solved normally I could think about porting it to Visual Circuit. The three exercises I chose were:
- Follow Road
- Visual Lander
- Labyrinth Escape

### Results
I managed to solve each of the three exercises that I chose in Python. However I had some problems porting it to Visual Circuit. Namely the class that controls all the drone functions called `DroneWrapper()` could not be passed around between blocks. Hence it was necessary for me to bunch together a lot of code in a custom code block.

After spending a lot of time debugging errors that inevitably cropped up I managed to finish Visual Lander before our weekly meeting on Friday.

### Goals for Next Week
The goals for the next week that we decided in the meet were as follows:
- Get a video of the solution of Visual Lander made. Here I would show how the blocks were created as well as a video of the exercise running on my machine
- Get a similar solution for Labyrinth Escape running
- Make a video for that as well if time permits
- By now one of my mentors Suhas had pushed the PR for the initial cross-platform implementation of Visual Circuit
I had to start with the new templates that each block would use as well
- Also I could come up with some ideas for new blocks
